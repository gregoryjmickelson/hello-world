Hello World!

About Me:
My name is Gregory J Mickelson.  You can call me Greg or Gregory, whichever you prefer.
I am currently an undergrad pursuing a Comprehensive Computer Science degree.  I plan to use this as a place to share my projects as I learn HTML and CSS as well as Javascript.  If I find some interesting Java projects that I want to build or would like to contribute to then I plan to incorporate those here as well.  Basically, this will be a hub for my projects that I wish to share.
I hope to go on to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails and get into artificial intelligence as well.  I suppose we will see where my journey takes me.  I hope to keep this as sort of a journal, I guess.
Feedback is welcome and encouraged.  I want to learn as deeply as I can and this is one way I hope to accomplish that.
